This is my blog. I don't really know what I'll use it for, but I want a blog
because I'm sure I'll come up with uses for it.

The source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/lengau/lengau.github.io).
The content is licenced under AGPL v3, except any code snippets etc., which are
public domain, or any parts I've copied from elsewhere, which retain their
original licence. Basically, don't copy what I'm saying unless you're going to
improve on it in the spirit of openness, but feel free to use what I write to 
improve your own work. Even closed source stuff. If you want clarification about
what I mean for your specific use case, please 
[file an issue](https://github.com/lengau/lengau.github.io/issues), but in 
general, I probably won't mind as long as you're not using what I said to make
me look bad.
